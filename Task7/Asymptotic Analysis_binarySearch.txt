Asymptotic analysis of Binary Search:

We need m number of splits to get out target from a set of n elements. So in 
m+1 splits a double in our collection results 2n. If we have a collection
of elements which are power of 2, result of using this logorithm is to base 2.

Thus m+1 is the maximum no. of splits we would require to find our target.

Therefore in the worst case Time Complexity of Binary Search Algorithm is O(logn).
